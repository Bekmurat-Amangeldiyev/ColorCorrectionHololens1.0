# ColorCorrectionHololens1.0

**"HoloLensForCV" library** in Github was used to connect the device(Microsoft Hololens 1.0) and computer to establish real-time color correction. 
File named "???" should be uploaded to Hololens 1.0 via Microsoft Visual Studio. _It should be notes that Visual Studio is supported on Windows devices._

**Matlab code for simulation of dichromacy type of colorblindness**(Protonopia, Deuteranopia, Tritonopia) is stored in "simulation.m' file. The "RGBSpectrum.png" image is included 
as an example to demonstrate how the color spectrum changes depending on the type of colorblindness. The simulation will be done using this image. It must be located at the same
directory as the code. 

**Image recolorization simulation files depending in the environment.**
