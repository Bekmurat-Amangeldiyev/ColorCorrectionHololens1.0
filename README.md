# ColorCorrectionHololens1.0

**"HoloLensForCV" library** in Github was used to connect the device(Microsoft Hololens 1.0) and computer to establish real-time color correction. 
Codes in "correction.txt", "deuteranopia corr.txt", "everythin.txt", "hsv.txt", and "Protanopia_simulation.txt" files are written in a programming language understandable by the 
AR glasses and should be uploaded via Visual Studio.  _It should be noted that Visual Studio is supported on Windows devices._

**Matlab code for simulation of dichromacy type of colorblindness**(Protonopia, Deuteranopia, Tritonopia) is stored in "simulation.m' file. The "RGBSpectrum.png" image is included 
as an example to demonstrate how the color spectrum changes depending on the type of color blindness. The simulation will be done using this image. It must be located in the same
directory as the code. 

**Image recolorization simulation files depending on the environment.**
